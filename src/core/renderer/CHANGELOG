# Changelog

## 0.0.1 - Initial Release

### Added

- Utility functions to convert parsed SVG shape data in JSON format into `Path2D` instances.
- Support for reusing `Path2D` objects for efficient canvas rendering.
- Rendering logic that applies:
  - `fill` and `stroke` styles
  - `linearGradient` support
  - `opacity` applied directly into fill/stroke color values (RGBA)

### Notes

- Assumes SVG shapes are pre-parsed into JSON format (`shapesJson`).
- Designed for animation-ready rendering.
