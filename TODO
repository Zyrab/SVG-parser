# 🛠️ TODO - Parsect

## ✅ Implemented
- [x] Copy/export of current canvas state
- [x] Dark and Light mode support
- [x] SVG `<g>` group support
- [x] SVG `<transform>` support
- [x] SVG `<linearGradient>` support
- [x] simple shapes (`<rect>`, `<circle>`, `<path>`, `<polygon>`, `<polyline> `, `<line>` and `<ellipse>`) support
- [x] svg `<style>`, `<fill>`, `<stroke>` , `<stroke-width>` and `<opacity>` support
- [x] `<path d="...">` conversion to `Path2D`

## 🐞 Bug Fixes
- [ ] Fix transformation application issues on arc commands

## ♻️ Refactoring & Code Quality
- [ ] Refactor core logic for readability and modularity
- [ ] Clean up rendering pipeline for better maintainability

## 🚀 Features & Enhancements
- [ ] Add support for  `<radialGradient>`
- [ ] Add support for SVG `<filter>` elements
- [ ] Allow merging of shapes with identical styles into a single `Path2D`
- [ ] Allow rendering only the selected SVG shape in the inspector
- [ ] Show visual feedback for unsupported SVG elements in inspector

## 💅 UI / UX Improvements
- [ ] Fix scroll indicator styling and behavior
- [ ] Apply custom UI styles for a more polished interface
- [ ] Add helpful links, tooltips, and contextual texts to improve usability

## 🧪 Testing & Validation
- [ ] Build unit tests for SVG parsing and rendering
- [ ] Implement basic SVG syntax validator (optional strict mode)

## 📊 Performance & Analytics
- [ ] Implement performance profiling tools for canvas render (esp. with filters)
- [ ] Track unique visitors (simple self-hosted analytics)
- [ ] Plan for future analytics (render time, shape complexity, memory usage)

## 🎞️ Future Feature: Animation & Frame Extraction
- [ ] Add support for parsing basic SVG animations (`<animate>`, `<animateTransform>`, etc.)
- [ ] Allow user to set FPS (e.g., 10 FPS) and extract frame-based shape maps
- [ ] Generate optimized maps for only the shapes that change between frames
- [ ] Treat these maps like sprite sheets for playback or export

## 💡 Ideas / Exploratory
- [ ] Add a debug panel to show transformation matrices and state
- [ ] SVG structure tree view with collapse/expand for easier inspection
- [ ] Save/load custom user settings (UI, view state, etc.)
- [ ] Export selected frames as SVG, PNG, or web-friendly format
- [ ] Add keyboard shortcuts for common actions (zoom, step frame, etc.)
